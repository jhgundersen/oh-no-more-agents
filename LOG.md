# Improvement log

One entry per iteration of the improvement loop, newest last. Each entry says
what was chosen and why, what changed, how it was checked, and what to look at
next. Start every iteration by reading the last entry's **Next**.

Baselines to measure against are in AGENTS.md ("Checking gameplay changes").
The CRAP figure is `npm run crap` — count of functions scoring over 30, and the
worst one.

## 1 — 2026-10-09 · Tooling: CRAP report and a smoke test

**Why first.** Nothing in `npm test` touched the game itself — it tested the
counter. A broken core file was only caught by someone remembering `npm run
sim`. And crapper needs coverage, which needs tests that run the game.

**Changed.**
- `tools/load-core.js`: the one loader for core files, used by `render.js` and
  `simcheck.js` (they each had a copy). It goes through `vm` with the real file
  name, which is what makes coverage attribute to `Sim.js`/`Draw.js`.
- `test/play.test.js`: plays three levels of every biome to the end and draws
  two frames of each. 30 levels, ~2s. Fails on a hang or an exception.
- `npm run coverage` (Node's built-in lcov) and `npm run crap` (fetches
  unclebob/crapper into `.crapper/`, gitignored).

**Checked.** `npm run sim play` unchanged at 98% / 88% / 46s / 0 hangs.

**CRAP baseline.** 331 functions, 57 over 30. Worst: `drawHazardKind`
(CC 279, 17k), `drawAgent` (CC 118), `drawAgentTrick` (CC 70). The simcheck
commands score high only because nothing tests the tester — ignore those.

**Next.** Graphics: every board is a flat background colour with the terrain on
it — there is no depth. A back wall / parallax layer per biome, drawn behind
terrain, would lift every level at once. Then split `drawHazardKind` (one
function per hazard kind) when next touching hazards.

## 2 — 2026-10-09 · Graphics: a far wall behind every biome

**Why.** Every board was terrain on a flat colour; nothing said "place".

**Changed.** `drawBackdrop` in `Draw.js`, called from `drawTerrain` before
the earth, with one small function per biome in `BACKDROPS`: cave pillars and
strata, ruined colonnade with arches, a mountain ridge (Frost), girders and
chains (Foundry), trunks and foliage (Jungle), crystals (Ice Cave), hull ribs
and portholes with stars (Spaceship), brick and gridded windows (Factory), rock
spires and kelp (Trench). Skyscraper already has its skyline and is left alone.
Three new palette shades `backDim/back/backLit` sit between the sky and
`dirtShade`. Props are placed with `backSpot`, which looks for open air — the
first pass put them at fixed heights and most landed behind solid earth.

**Checked.** Rendered every biome and level 7 in all five themes: the wall is
visible but darker than any walkable ground, agents read as before. Draw-only;
static, terrain layer, seeded from the level. New functions all CRAP < 10.
The Omarchy plugin copy now drifts (`npm run sync:check`); not synced — the
sync is the user's call.

**Next.** Animation: the backdrop is static. Cheap, stateless ambient motion
on the actor pass (drawMachines) — dust motes in caves, falling leaves in the
Jungle, snow in Frost, sparks in the Foundry — as pure functions of `w.ticks`
like the Trench's fish.
